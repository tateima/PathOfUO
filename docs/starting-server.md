# Starting the server

Now that the software has been built, all you need to do is run it!
Everything is run from the _Distribution_ folder.

=== "Windows"
    Using _windows terminal_, _git bash_, or _powershell_, run:
    ```bash
    cd Distribution
    ModernUO.exe
    ```

=== "OSX/Linux"
    Using _terminal_, run:
    ```bash
    cd Distribution
    dotnet run ModernUO.dll
    ```
