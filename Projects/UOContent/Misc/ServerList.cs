         * The default setting for Address, a value of 'null', will use your local IP address. If all of your local IP addresses
         * are private network addresses and AutoDetect is 'true' then RunUO will attempt to discover your public IP address
         * for you automatically.
         *
         * If you do not plan on allowing clients outside of your LAN to connect, you can set AutoDetect to 'false' and leave
         * Address set to 'null'.
         *
         * If your public IP address cannot be determined, you must change the value of Address to your public IP address
         * manually to allow clients outside of your LAN to connect to your server. Address can be either an IP address or
         * a hostname that will be resolved when RunUO starts.
         *
         * If you want players outside your LAN to be able to connect to your server and you are behind a router, you must also
         * forward TCP port 2593 to your private IP address. The procedure for doing this varies by manufacturer but generally
         * involves configuration of the router through your web browser.
         *
         * ServerList will direct connecting clients depending on both the address they are connecting from and the address and
         * port they are connecting to. If it is determined that both ends of a connection are private IP addresses, ServerList
         * will direct the client to the local private IP address. If a client is connecting to a local public IP address, they
         * will be directed to whichever address and port they initially connected to. This allows multihomed servers to function
         * properly and fully supports listening on multiple ports. If a client with a public IP address is connecting to a
         * locally private address, the server will direct the client to either the AutoDetected IP address or the manually entered
         * IP address or hostname, whichever is applicable. Loopback clients will be directed to loopback.
         *
         * If you would like to listen on additional ports (i.e. 22, 23, 80, for clients behind highly restrictive egress
         * firewalls) or specific IP addresses you can do so by modifying the file SocketOptions.cs found in this directory.
